# Automatic Dart Scorer (Web App)

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).  
2. Allow camera access.  
3. Press "Set Baseline" before first throw.  
4. Press "Calibrate Board" and click the centre and outer edge.  
5. Throw darts — score appears live!  
6. On PWA-supporting devices, click "Add to Home Screen" to install.

## Notes
- Works best with steady lighting.  
- For multiple darts, reset baseline after each throw.  
- Optional: train CoreML or TensorFlow.js model for improved dart tip detection.
